  paragraphOne: `Hi, my name's Mohamud and I'm a full-stack developer who's passionate about design!. I've just finished an intensive 3+ months programming course and I'm now looking for my first dev role. In those three months, I created various real work projects using Java, MERN Stack and many more`,
  paragraphTwo: `I'm a developer, because I'm inspired by the idea of being a better me today than I was yesterday. Put simply, I love to learn and this project is a great example of that! I picked up Gatsby and GraphQl so I could implement a Contentful CMS and I  also worked in some snazzy GSAP animations`,

    info: 'For this project I created an Inventory management system written in Java. Using GCP to host a MySQL database, this project aimed at creating a system that can manipulate data on the cloud by allowing users to create, update, request the information or delete it. Planning process was thorough and included Agile methodology and the utilisation of JIRA boards. The development included a Java code to run the processes with Junit and Mockito as unit tests. The project included a completed project management board, including user stories, acceptance criteria which were estimations via story points, and prioritisation via MoSCoW methodology. This produced a working inventory-management system capable of tracking & manipulating customerâ€™s information, orders details and item data. I then presented the project and explained the project process in detail.',

The structure of this project followed a three-tier architecture: the front end was built using visual studio code and written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The backend was built using Spring and written in Java and finally the locally hosted database was built using SQL. The application was then fully tested with Unit, Automated and Integration testing. Finally, it was linked to SonarQube to allow static analysis and improvement of the code.',

I also lead the design aspect of the website, designing our custom images on Photoshop and ensuring that the interface works seamlessly. This web application was developed and implemented with the goal of providing an informative and visually appealing webpage for users to interact with. his project was a great experience for us to successfully incorporate an agile methodology and understand its benefits for application development.',
