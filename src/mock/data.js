    info: 'For this project I created an Inventory management system written in Java. Using GCP to host a MySQL database, this project aimed at creating a system that can manipulate data on the cloud by allowing users to create, update, request the information or delete it. Planning process was thorough and included Agile methodology and the utilisation of JIRA boards. The development included a Java code to run the processes with Junit and Mockito as unit tests. The project included a completed project management board, including user stories, acceptance criteria which were estimations via story points, and prioritisation via MoSCoW methodology. This produced a working inventory-management system capable of tracking & manipulating customerâ€™s information, orders details and item data. I then presented the project and explained the project process in detail.',

The structure of this project followed a three-tier architecture: the front end was built using visual studio code and written in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The backend was built using Spring and written in Java and finally the locally hosted database was built using SQL. The application was then fully tested with Unit, Automated and Integration testing. Finally, it was linked to SonarQube to allow static analysis and improvement of the code.',
